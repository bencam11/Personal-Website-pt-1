    <h1>Benjamin Campbell</h1>
        <p>I've done eight years in the United States Army which has groomed me to be an organized and
            motivated employee eager to apply time management and organizational skills in any work
            field that would have me. My diverse work history from truck driver to restaurant manager
            shows I can excel at following orders and giving them. I've always carried myself as a
            professional who will get the job done all while maintaining company standards and doing so
            with a positive attitude. Throughout my years of various work experience I've had to work with
            people of different personalities and I have always had pleasant and cordial relationships with
            all of the staff, whether they're my employee or employer.

        </p>
